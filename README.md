Components used for this project ESP32 (Feather V2), loadcell (10kg), Load Cell Amplifier (HX711) and TFT-screen (ILI9341)

This code utilizes two UIs one for taring/zeroing the weight called normal UI and the other UI for changing the calibration factor so that the known weight is shown on the screen this UI is called calibration UI.
